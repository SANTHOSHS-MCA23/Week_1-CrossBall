# Week_1-CrossBall
This project features a simple green-colored ball that follows a continuous bouncing pattern between the top and bottom of the screen, creating a perpetual up-and-down motion every time the page is loaded. The ball is constructed using HTML and styled using CSS, while its interactive behavior is orchestrated through JavaScript to enable various events and animations.
